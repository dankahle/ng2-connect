converting to beta.6


trying to decided just how you want to hack things up. One things' for sure:

getting rid of any ::shadow and /deep/ references

you're on leftNav now and wanted to get rid of the jq stuff in favor of View/ContentChild, but you need to find
something via classname, i.e. it's not a component. ViewChild won't cut it then and Query only works for content
children (really?, need to test this out). Query will work with #variables in the html. Maybe try that to see if that
 will work ...

 either way, go thorugh and lose any ::shadow and /deep/ refrences and try to incorporate view/contentChildren in there
